# Luma Take-Home

Modern engineering is about directing leverage — tools, judgment, taste — toward real outcomes. This take-home is designed around that.

Pick a problem. Build something that works. You have ~1 working day.

**You must use AI coding tools** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, whatever you prefer. These problems are scoped so that AI is necessary to ship something real in a day. We want to see how you direct the tools: how you plan, how you course-correct, what you accept, and what you push back on.

---

## Choose a Problem

Pick the one that excites you most. These are deliberately open-ended — we want to see what directions you take and what decisions you make.

### 1. Reverse-Engineer an Undocumented API

Pick any website that doesn't have a public API. Reverse-engineer how it works under the hood, then build a useful tool on top of it.

**Figure out the API, then build something real with it.**

### 2. Fix Something Annoying

Pick a website you use daily. Identify something that genuinely annoys you about it. Build a browser extension that fixes it.

**Find the annoyance, ship the fix.**

### 3. Clone and Improve

Pick one specific feature or interaction from an app you admire. Rebuild it, then make it better — faster, cleaner, more thoughtful, whatever "better" means to you.

**Rebuild it, improve it, and explain what you changed and why.**

## Tips

The candidates who do best don't start by building — they start by getting sharp on the problem. It's easy to either throw everything at the wall or get heads-down on making something work, and miss the more important question: *what's actually worth solving here, and for whom?*

Slow down before you write a line of code. The thinking you do upfront will shape everything.

## What We're Looking For

We want real, working software — not a prototype, not a toy. You'll likely focus on a slice of the problem, but that slice should actually work and be something you'd put in front of a user. Show polish where it matters to you — in the UX, the details, the interactions that feel right. Ship a finished product, not a proof of concept.

We expect the result to be better than what an AI would produce on its own with minimal guidance. The AI writes the code; you own the decisions — what to build, how it should work, what to cut, and what to polish. Specifically, we're paying attention to:

- **How you approach new problems** — how you break down ambiguity, decide what to tackle first, and make good decisions with incomplete information
- **How you use AI tools** — not just that you used them, but how you directed them, where you pushed back, and where your judgment shaped the result
- **The unique perspective you bring** — the product instincts, technical taste, or domain insight that made your solution distinct from what anyone else would have built

## What to Deliver

### 1. Working software

Build your solution directly in this repo. It should run. Include setup instructions that work in a fresh Linux container — we will run your code in one during review. If you use Docker, provide a `docker-compose.yml` for one-command setup.

**If your project is deployable, deploy it.** We want to experience what you built, not just read about it. A live URL — whether it's a web app, an API endpoint, a browser extension, or a hosted service — goes a long way. Vercel, Railway, Fly, a VPS, whatever works. Include the URL in your APPROACH.md.

A `.env.example` is included with stub keys for providers we have accounts with (Anthropic, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Google Cloud, AWS). Copy it to `.env`, use whichever keys your solution needs, and document any others.

### 2. APPROACH.md

- What you built and why you picked this problem
- Key decisions and tradeoffs
- What you intentionally left out
- What breaks first under pressure
- What you'd build next

### 3. Video walkthrough

Record a short video (~5 minutes) showing what you built. Demo the key flows — whether that's a UI walkthrough, a CLI session, or hitting your API — explain your decisions, and highlight anything you're particularly proud of. This is your chance to show us the experience through your eyes.

**Paste your video link (Loom, Google Drive, YouTube, etc.) into `video.md`.**

### 4. AI session history

Your AI session logs (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) are packaged automatically when you run `./submit.sh`. If you used other AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.), export those conversations and include them in your repo before submitting.

This is a required deliverable. We review your AI interaction to understand how you work — how you plan, iterate, and direct the tools.

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Extract the challenge archive you downloaded
tar xzf challenge.tar.gz && cd *eng-take-home*

# 2. Create your own private repo and push to it
git init && git add -A && git commit -m "initial"
gh repo create my-take-home --private --source=. --push

# 3. Copy the env file and fill in any keys you need
cp .env.example .env
```

Now build your solution. Commit and push as you go.

---

## Submitting

When you're ready, run the submit script from your repo root:

```bash
./submit.sh
```

This handles everything: packages your AI session history, commits and pushes your latest changes, grants reviewer access, and registers your submission. You'll see a confirmation when it's done.
